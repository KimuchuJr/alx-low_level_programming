## Learning Objectives

### General

- **Why C programming is awesome**: C is valued for its efficiency, control over hardware, and extensive use in system programming.
- **Inventor of C**: C was invented by Dennis Ritchie.
- **Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds**: Dennis Ritchie co-created C, Brian Kernighan co-authored "The C Programming Language," and Linus Torvalds is known for creating Linux.
- **gcc main.c**: Compiles `main.c` into an executable file using the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc).
- **Entry point**: Refers to the start of program execution, typically the `main` function in C programs.
- **main function**: The core function in C programs where execution begins.
- **Printing text**: Achieved using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar` functions in C.
- **sizeof operator**: Determines the size of a data type in bytes.
- **Compiling with gcc**: Uses the gcc compiler to translate C code into executable programs.
- **Default program name**: The default name of the executable when compiled with gcc is `a.out`.
- **Official C coding style**: Follows guidelines such as those defined by Betty-style for consistent and readable code.
- **Finding headers**: Includes appropriate headers for standard library functions in C programs.
- **main function return value**: Determines the exit status of the program.

### Project Requirements

- **Editors**: Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs.
- **Compilation**: Use `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` to ensure error-free code.
- **README**: Includes project descriptions and repository summaries.
- **Shell Scripts**: Scripts should be two lines long and start with `#!/bin/bash`.
