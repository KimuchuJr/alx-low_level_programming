A double linked list, also known as a doubly linked list, is a data structure in which each node contains a reference to both the previous and the next node in the list. This allows for efficient traversal in both directions. In Python, you can implement a double linked list using a class to represent the nodes and another class to represent the list itself.

This is a basic implementation of a doubly linked list in Python. You can extend it by adding other operations such as deleting nodes, inserting at specific positions, or searching for elements.
