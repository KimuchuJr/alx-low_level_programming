A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that allows mapping keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index, or hash code, that determines the location in an array where the corresponding value is stored. The goal is to assign each key to a unique bucket, but collisions may occur when multiple keys produce the same hash code.

Hash tables have a constant average time complexity for lookups, regardless of the number of elements in the table. This makes them efficient for retrieving values based on keys. They also support insertions and deletions with amortized constant average cost per operation.

Hashing provides a tradeoff between space and time. With unlimited memory, the entire key could be used as an index for direct value retrieval. Conversely, if unlimited time is available, values can be stored without considering their keys, and searching algorithms like binary or linear search can be used.

In many cases, hash tables are more efficient than search trees or other lookup structures. They are widely used in various software applications, especially for associative arrays, database indexing, caches, and sets.
